                <p>This image uses a public domain image from nasa as a background and layers a dall over it. drown ontop of the dall with a photoshop brush is a pentegram and using a seperate brush on the same layer are &quot;blood trails&quot;. This whole layer has an opacity applied to it to blend better as well as a gradiant funning from top (lighter red) to bottom (darker red). The eye whites of the dall have been cut to reveal the background. Finnally, a butterfly is finally layered ontop of all of this. </p>

                <p>This image has 4 layers. The background, the man, the butterflys, and finnally the mans lip. The lip is the last layer to make the illusion that the man is ingesting the butterfly. additionally, the butterflies are warped to apear to be at different angles (perspectives) then they were in the original images. </p>

                <p>This image has a couple layers of the original background plus a new background color and a the head is cropped out and turned. There is excessive use of the spot healing and healing brush to get rid of ertifacts but also to help get rid of the old background under where the head used to be. Finally, the eyes are on a seperate layer with a slight transparency to them and the retinas are redrawn with the brush tool. </p>

                <p>This image is origannally a series of layers that filtered the background (originally grayscale) to be colorful. Each color is a layer and each color is overlayed over a diffent parrelel set of walls. Finaaly, a gradiant is overlayed over the entire thing. The original purpose was to choose overlay settings that could only bland the gradiant onto present layers. After turning off the background, the image looked more interesting so it was kept that way. </p>

                <p>This graphic is somewhat self explanuitory. The panguin killed the whale and the girl looked on in harror. the panguin felt so cool he held his pose for a while while the girl mornes over the whale in disbelief. In the geraphic, the main challenge was posing the limbs to look somewhat natural. The animal models are particularly difficult to pose but it was managable. The background and ground layer were set to white and the light source was set at a 15 degree ange overhead the camera towards the scene. </p>

                <p>This was an etempt at leaning how to pose charecters and have them interact with objects. Aditionally, the model used was a nude version of &quot;James&quot; and clothing was added. It became clear early on that this would be difficult and the pants were remoived partly because of this diffuculty and partly because the absurdaty of it seemed entertaining. In particular, the skin showing through on the shirt was a pleasant suprise because it seems to give the ilusion that the clothing is warn and battered. </p>

                <p>This graphic is a still life of a doll in a chair in a &quot;room&quot;. This was an early experiment but I liked the way that it tuned out enough to include it. The walls are each given a &quot;meterial&quot; image that happens to be a rendering of the scene each with something added incrementally. </p>

                <p>The animation was a true learning expiriance as to how long something may take to render. I am overal disapointed with some of the inconsistencies that didn't show up in the preview. The backdrops that are transitioned through were rendered in the final but mostly invisable in the original set that was used. Additionally, at the end, the walls that appear were out of frame in the preview and the light sources were set to animate to black over the last five seconds which is missed because of the walls. </p>
