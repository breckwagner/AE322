      <h3>Graphic Image #1</h3>
      <p>This image uses a public domain image from NASA as a background and layers an image of a doll over it. drown onto of the doll with a Photoshop brush is a pentagram and using a separate brush on the same layer are &quot;blood trails&quot;. This whole layer has an opacity applied to it to blend better as well as a gradient funning from top (lighter red) to bottom (darker red). The eye whites of the doll have been cut to reveal the background. Finally, a butterfly is finally layered on top of all of this. </p>

      <h3>Graphic Image #2</h3>
      <p>This image has 4 layers. The background, the man, the butterflies, and finally the mans lip. The lip is the last layer to make the illusion that the man is ingesting the butterfly. additionally, the butterflies are warped to appear to be at different angles (perspectives) then they were in the original images. </p>

      <h3>Graphic Image #3</h3>
      <p>This image has a couple layers of the original background plus a new background color and a the head is cropped out and turned. There is excessive use of the spot healing and healing brush to get rid of artifacts but also to help get rid of the old background under where the head used to be. Finally, the eyes are on a separate layer with a slight transparency to them and the retinas are redrawn with the brush tool. </p>

      <h3>Graphic Image #4</h3>
      <p>This image is originally a series of layers that filtered the background (originally grayscale) to be colorful. Each color is a layer and each color is overlaid over a different parallel set of walls. Finally, a gradient is overlaid over the entire thing. The original purpose was to choose overlay settings that could only bland the gradient onto present layers. After turning off the background, the image looked more interesting so it was kept that way. </p>

      <h3>3D Image #1</h3>
      <p>This graphic is somewhat self explanatory. The penguin killed the whale and the girl looked on in horror. the penguin felt so cool he held his pose for a while the girl mourns over the whale in disbelief. In the graphic, the main challenge was posing the limbs to look somewhat natural. The animal models are particularly difficult to pose but it was manageable. The background and ground layer were set to white and the light source was set at a 15 degree angle overhead the camera towards the scene. </p>

      <h3>3D Image #2</h3>
      <p>This was an attempt at leaning how to pose characters and have them interact with objects. Additionally, the model used was a nude version of &quot;James&quot; and clothing was added. It became clear early on that this would be difficult and the pants were removed partly because of this difficulty and partly because the absurdity of it seemed entertaining. In particular, the skin showing through on the shirt was a pleasant surprise because it seems to give the illusion that the clothing is warn and battered. </p>

      <h3>3D Image #3</h3>
      <p>This graphic is a still life of a doll in a chair in a &quot;room&quot;. This was an early experiment but I liked the way that it tuned out enough to include it. The walls are each given a &quot;meterial&quot; image that happens to be a rendering of the scene each with something added incrementally. </p>

      <h3>3D Animation</h3>
      <p>The animation was a true learning experience as to how long something may take to render. I am overall disappointed with some of the inconsistencies that didn't show up in the preview. The backdrops that are transitioned through were rendered in the final but mostly invisible in the original set that was used. Additionally, at the end, the walls that appear were out of frame in the preview and the light sources were set to animate to black over the last five seconds which is missed because of the walls. </p>

      <h3>Audio Production</h3>
      <p>The audio was much harder then I thought it would be. Synths from "TheFatRat". Overall, it was another fun experiment. The track has 5 layers. The background ambient noise is a voice track put through a Paulstretch filter at 10x. The vocals in this piece are put through reverb and several other filters. The beat is a collection of synths stretched to match the tempo of the click track which I left in. It also had reverb/reverse applied to it. The opening ominous chains is a Paulstretch of a jail bars FX.</p>

      <h4>Layers</h4>
      <p>This is a simple example of video production. Not much to say about it. Fun to make but hard to sync with audio at times. Enjoy!</p>
